The group uses modern in-situ observations (e.g HF radars, moorings, and gliders) and satellite remote sensing in combination with advanced numerical modelling to explain fundamental coastal ocean dynamics, and to gain an integrated, quantitative understanding of their impacts on coastal ocean bio-geo-chemical processes. The group are a lead organisation in Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (www.imos.org.au), responsible for the ocean-observing programme along southeastern Australia. The group has expertise in the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) and 4DVar data assimilation, with strong links to international collaborators. The group collaborate locally with state agencies on applied aspects of bio-physical oceanography.\n\nThe role of the \n\nPostdoctoral Fellow: Physical Oceanographer \n\ninvolves research into the dynamics and prediction of the East Australian Current. In an effort to derive maximum benefit from the present and proposed ocean observing system the objective of the role is to conduct Observing System Simulation Experiments using the regional ocean modelling system (ROMS) to guide future ocean observing initiatives.

If you’re a good fit, you’ll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we’ll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it’s really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.\n\nKeep being awesome, cloud gurus!\n\nChanges as a result of COVID-19\n\nTL;DR - All interviews will be video calls using Zoom\n\nThe health and wellbeing of our current and prospective staff is our number one concern so at the moment, we’re doing all our interviews using Zoom. That’s the only major change. Substantively the interview will be exactly the same. If you are invited to a video interview, your recruiter will provide you with a link to the call and some tips around how to set yourself up. You don’t need a Zoom licence, just a decent internet connection and a compatible device.\n\nShow more\n\nShow less",
